    "I'm working on coming up with an SVM classification project to post, and have been looking around for interesting, publicly available datasets to use. I've been considering looking at data from the Midlife in the United States Longitudinal Study (<a href=\"http://midus.wisc.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIDUS</a>)&ast;. This is a large dataset that is well-known in Social Psychology. It has the benefit of a large number of variables (>2000), but with that comes the challenge of sorting out what's actually included and what variables of interest you want to examine. This is always challenging with large datasets, since the variable names often take a form that are not super intuitive (e.g. X1, X2 ... X2000). The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research hosts the data, and you could use their <a href=\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/2760/variables\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> to explore variables and search by keyword. When you download the data, there are also PDF files that summarize variables as well. These approaches are fine if you have a good idea of what you're looking for and the goal is not to automate any part of the analysis process, but it would be much easier and more convenient if you could incorporate this process in Python. This is where XML comes into play. Luckily, in addition to ICPSR website and PDF files, you can find an XML file that summarizes the data <a href=\"https://midus1-project1.ssc.wisc.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I'll use that file and Python's xml.etree.ElementTree module to write a function that will return variable names and details based on a search term.\n",
    "\n",
    "&ast;MIDUS data is available to the public, but you must register first and agree to some very reasonable terms of use.  \n",

    "__Resources__\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't work with XML every day, so had to do a little searching to figure out how it works. If you're not familiar, I recommend you start by looking through the Python <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#module-xml.etree.ElementTree\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> on ElementTree first. I also found Charles Severence's introduction <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OnGNUPxlho\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> helpful.\n",

    "\n",
    "I'm not going to print out the XML file itself here, but I found it helpful to open it up in a text editor to get an idea of what's included and the structure of it. Once I did that, I figured out that I'm most interested in the dataDscr element, which also includes variable names, labels, and the text of the question itself (if applicable). Without actually printing the document, the basic structure of the stuff under dataDscr I'm really interested in looks something like this (though there's a ton more under \"var\" and other nodes that could be of interest):\n",

    "So there you have it. If a dataset with a lot of variables has an associated XML file, using ElementTree to parse thorugh everything can help a lot as you start looking at what questions you can answer and problems you can solve with the data. Wrap everything in a function, and you can quickly get a sense of what kind of variables are available. I also like the idea of sticking with parsing XML directly with a function like this because you can easily add more attributes to the function if you need more information. For example, this file also contains value labels and some other information like minimum and maximum values that, if needed, can easily be added to the function. \n",
