# CDC Binary Classification ML Comparison

I compared the performance of various classifers on predicting history of high blood pressure using CDC behavioral data. The purpose of this project was to learn to use ML tools and go through the motions of various classification strategies. As such, some approaches may be a bit overkill or unnecessary. Still, the exercise was informative and I was able to learn a lot. The data is publicly available [here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2017.html).

This is a six part project. You can view the Jupyter Notebook for each part below:
