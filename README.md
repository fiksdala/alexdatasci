# data-projects
Occasionally I do data science side projects for practice and/or to learn new skills. This repo contains the code and content of those projects. These projects were also formerly available on my now-defunct personal website 'alexdatasci.com'. Any references or links you may find to that domain will not work; however, all the code and content is still available in this repo.

## What's in this repository?

This repository contains full code, summaries, and other related documents of my data projects. Completed projects are linked below. Any other directories in data-projects that do not have links below are not complete and may not have adequate documentation.

## Projects

Every project will be located in a dedicated folder within this repository. For convenience, I'll include links to finished projects below. Most projects are viewable as Jupyter notebooks or HTML.

## Who am I?

My name is Alex Fiksdal, and I recently completed my PhD in Psychology with a focus on Biological Health Psychology (psychoneuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology) at Brandeis University. My academic career focused on the impact of stress on health. In particular, my research focuses on how psychological factors (e.g. chronic stress, depression, anxiety, appraisals) are associated with physiological responses to acute stress (e.g. cortisol). I have a strong background in statistics, and really enjoy learning and applying methods of data analysis in order to solve puzzles and tell data-driven stories.
