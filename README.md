[Academic Performance (first post)](https://github.com/fiksdala/alexdatasci/blob/master/academic_performance/academic_performance.md)

## Who am I?

My name is Alex Fiksdal, and I’m an ABD (all but dissertation) Psychology PhD student at Brandeis University. My academic career has been focused on Health Psychology, and our lab (the Laboratory for Biological Health Psychology) studies the impact of stress on health. In particular, my research focuses on how psychological factors (e.g. chronic stress, depression, anxiety, appraisals) are associated with physiological responses to acute stress (e.g. cortisol). I have a strong background in statistics, and really enjoy learning and applying methods of data analysis in order to solve puzzles and tell data-driven stories. This is a large part of why I’m also planning on leaving the academic world, transitioning to industry in the broadly-defined ‘data science’ field.
