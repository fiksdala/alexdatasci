# Hierarchical agglomerative clustering of time series cortisol data using dynamic time warping similarity measure

The Jupyter notebook linked below summarizes this project. Briefly, the goal was to practice time series clustering using the DTW similarity measure. Cortisol data was taken from the publicly available MIDUS Biomarker dataset. You have to register in order to gain access [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACDA/studies/36901).
