    abstract "BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder
 (MDD) have been associated with increased and blunted HPA axis reactivity to
 social stress. However, research focusing on associations between HPA axis
 responses to stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression among individuals
 without a diagnosis remains an understudied area of research. METHODS: One
 hundred forty-three adults (52% female) completed the Trier Social Stress
 Test (TSST). Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed prior to the
 TSST using the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and
 Depression Scale (HADS). HPA axis responses were assessed by measuring
 salivary cortisol at baseline and following the TSST. Reactivity to and
 recovery from stress were assessed using multilevel growth modeling
 controlling for age, BMI, and sex among the full sample and a subset of
 cortisol responders (n = 72). RESULTS: Anxiety symptoms were positively
 associated with flatter recovery slopes among the full sample (t(122.3) =
 2.082, p = .039). Among cortisol responders, depression symptoms were
 associated with steeper reactivity (t(63.32) = 2.53, p = .026) and recovery
 (t(58.75)=-2.20, p = .03). Anxiety symptoms were associated with marginally
 flatter reactivity (t(64.00)=-1.97, p = .053) and significantly flatter
 recovery (t(59.22) = 2.29, p = .025). CONCLUSION: Symptoms of anxiety and
 depression among individuals without a psychiatric diagnosis are associated
 with blunted and exaggerated cortisol responses to and recovery from stress.
 Such patterns could indicate increased risk for unhealthy HPA axis
 dysregulation, allostatic load, and disease.",
